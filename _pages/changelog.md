# What's New

## **Version 0.4.12** `Latest`

Public changes:

- New input method. Drag two corners of a rectangle to make a selection. Let's hope it is faster than manually tapping each one of the four corners.
- Replaced the application sounds with more pleasant ones.
- Fixed some bugs in the settings window.

Developer changes:

- Refactored some application components to make them easier to change in the future.
