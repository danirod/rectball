# Privacy Policy

Privacy is an important right and this application should lead by example.

This is just a game made in my free time, I am not in the data market. This game does not collect personal
information. Starting on version 0.4.12, the game does not collect data at all, and the old analytic
integrations (Google Analytics) have been removed.

The Google Play version of the game is linked against the Google Play Games Services. You can use this
feature to join a leaderboard, collect achievements, share your high score and compete against your
friends or other people. This feature is opt-in and you can choose whether to join or dismiss.

That's all. Stay safe out there and be careful.
