/**
 * This class delegates into the appropriate code for setting the game insets
 * depending on the Android version of the device. The code will be removed
 * and reversed once support for Android 4.x is removed from the game.
 *
 * This class exists mostly because AndroidX does not work anymore with
 * Android 4.4, so the WindowInsetCompat actually does not do anything. Since
 * Android 4.4 still requests translucent status bars, not setting the insets
 * causes the game to render behind the status bar. A legacy and deprecated
 * code for setting the insets is used in that platform.
 *
 * Android 4.3 and below are not a problem since translucent status bar is not
 * enabled on those platforms, thus it is not needed to configure the margins
 * and paddings since the window is compressed anyway.
