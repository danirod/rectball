        <item>Welcome to Rectball. In this tutorial I\'ll explain you the how to play.</item>
        <item>This is the board. This is where all the fun happens during a game.</item>
        <item>This is the timer. When it empties, the game is over.</item>
        <item>And this the score. As you add points, they will be showed here.</item>
        <item>To make points in Rectball, you\'ll have to make a rectangle using the colors.</item>
        <item>Press four balls that are the same colour and that form a rectangle.</item>
        <item>Excellent! That was easy, now let\'s try to make a bigger rectangle.</item>
        <item>Very good! The bigger the rectangle is, the more points you get.</item>
